## Hierarchical Loop-based Multiview Registration Framework

HL-MRF can automatically perform the point-cloud-based registration for large-scale TLS scans without any artificial target. The main focus of our framework lies in the efficiency of processing large-scale TLS scans and being able to tolerate pairwise registration failure for robustness. The proposed hierarchical registration strategy and the loop-based coarse registration method deal with them respectively.
